### Hi there and Welcome to my GitHub ðŸ‘‹

# I'm **Emilie**, a Front-end developer

<img align="right" width="33%" src="./assets/images/emoji.png">
I chose to become a developer because it's an exciting job with multiple possibilities of evolution!
I have always been curious and an eternal learner, and we can say that with this job, my thirst for knowledge and permanent improvements are fulfilled!
In addition to being full of personal and professional challenges, it is also a field in which you meet a lot of interesting people with whom the exchanges are very enriching from a technical but also human point of view.
And on top of that, what a pleasure it is to break our heads to solve problems in our code that will in turn solve problems in the lives of the users of our sites and applications!
